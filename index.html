<h2> C Programing</h2>
<p> C is a high level programming language. It a popular and user friendly language. In 1972, Dennis Ritchie invented this language in Bell Lab.
It is said that, if you know that language other computer languages become very easy to learn.It is a wonderful structured programing language, 
you can co-ordinate many simple works to make a Complex programme.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="alg & flow" > 
<h2>Algorithm & Flowchart </h2>
<p>First of all, to solve a problem you have to think about it and understand every part to crack the problem. It is very helpful to think the solution step by step.
Each of the steps are <b>Algorithm</b>. Sometimes it becomes really easy to draw every steps to solve.This is called <b>Flowchart</b>. Every programmers try to make 
algorithm & flowchart before they start programing.  </p>

<section class="main-section" id="data" > 
<h2>Data Type & Format Specifier</h2>
<p> A computer processor alows different types of data to calculate something. In C Programme there also some specific data types. Some of them are <i>char, int, float</i> 
and a lot more.
<h3>char</h3>
<p>It is the first four letters of <b>character</b>.They can only contain a single letter ('a', 'D', '!', '5').They hold 1byte storage in computer memory. </p>
<h3>int</h3>
<p>Having first three letters of <b>integer</b>, it is named <b>int</b>. They hold 4bytes storage of computer memory. That means you can store 2<sup>32</sup> or 4294967296 variety of integer numbers</p>
<h3>float</h3>
<p>It is used to store floating point number. They also hold 4 bytes storage of computer memory. </p>
<h3>Format Specifier</h3>
<p>To take input or display output programme need to specify the data type.This is called <b>format specifier</b>. <br>Here is some data types and format specifier.</p>
<table border="2px" style="border-collapse:collapse;width:98%;" class="dtable" >
<tr><th>Data Types</th><th>Format Specifier</th></tr>
<tr><td>char</td><td>%c</td></tr>
<tr><td>int</td><td>%d</td></tr>
<tr><td>float</td><td>%f</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="Variables" >
<h2>Variable Declaration</h2>
<p> In programing world variables are just like what you learnt in mathematics.There's no different between them.You can easily set a name for any types of data.Before started you have to recall the data type first. 
 Another thing is that C has some reserved words called <b>Keyword</b>.You can't use those names for variables and function name.To set a name you alsi have to follow some instructions.
 </p>
 <code><pre>
int decimal_number;
decimal_number=10;
float floating_number1;
floating_number1=2.096;
 </pre></code>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="in&out" >
<h2>Input Output Statement</h2>
<p>As a programmer,you have to always work with input and output.In this section we will learn how to take input from user and display some output. </p>
<p>To display anything as output you have to use <strong>printf()</strong> function.This is a function which is defined in your header function.In this function everything will be displayed that is written 
within double quotation(" ").</p>
<code><pre>
printf("Hello world!")
</pre></code>
<p>This programme will so the following output.</p>
<code><pre>
Hello world!
</pre></code>
<p>In same way you can take input from user.So that you have to use <strong>scanf()</strong> function.It is same like printf() function.Within the double quotation(" ") you have to write the format specifier as you learnt before.
And out side the quotation you have to define each format specifier with respective variable name with comma(,). </p>
<code><pre>
 int number_1=3;
 int number_2=5;
 scanf("%d\n%d",number_1,
 number_2);
</pre></code>
<p>The code will show the following output.</p>
<code><pre>
_
</pre></code><br>
<p> It means your programme is ready to take input now.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="fprogramme" >
<h2>First Programme</h2>
<p>
Let's start programing! In this section we will get introduced to a formal structure of C Programme and also run a programme.<br>
<code><pre>
#include stdio.h<sup><span id="note">(*wrap with this <>)</span></sup>
int main(){

printf("This is my first 
programme.");

return 0;
}
</pre></code>
<br>
<p>This is the output.</p>
<br>
<code><pre>
<p>This is my first programme.</p>
</pre></code><br>
<p>In the following code we can see several unknown terms.Now we'll learn them one by one.</p>
<p> In the second line you can see <b>main()</b> it is a main function. Every C programme starts running with this function.Curly brackets define that the main function begins at 2nd line and ends at 8th line.</p>
<p>After that, the <b>printf()</b> function is also a function that you learnt before.But how this function will work it wasn’t defined anywhere else. The <b>stdio.h</b> is such a header file which defines how the functions in this programme will work.</p>
<p>In the first line #include stdio.h<sup><span id="note">(*wrap with this <>)</span></sup> defines that now you can use the header file in your programme. </p>
</p>
</section>
<hr>
<section class="main-section" id="mprogramme" >
<h2>More Programmes</h2>
<p>Now as a programmer you can do anything you want.So now we'll practice C by making an addition calculater.</p>
<p>At first let's think the algorithm. First you will take two numbers from user as input. Then your programme will calculate them. After that you will show the final result.</p>
<code><pre>
#include stdio.h<sup><span id="note">(*wrap with this <>)</span></sup>
int main(){

int number_1,number_2;
int sum;
printf("Enter the first
number.");
scanf("%d",number_1);
printf("Enter the second
number.");
scanf("%d",number_2);

sum=number_1+number_2;
printf("Your result is %d",
sum);

return 0;
}
</pre></code>
</section>
<hr>
<section class="main-section" id="oper" >
<h2>Operators</h2>
<p>There are different types of operators.Let's have look at the table bellow.This a very important term for the next chapters</p>
<table border="2px" style="border-collapse:collapse;width:98%;" class="dtable">
<tr><th>Arithmetic Operator</th><th>Relational Operators</th><th>Logical Operator</th></tr>
<tr><td>+</td><td>==</td><td>&&(and)</td></tr>
<tr><td>-</td><td>!=</td><td>||(or)</td></tr>
<tr><td>*</td><td>></td><td>!(not)</td></tr>
<tr><td>/</td><td>>=</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><=</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
</section>
<hr>
<section class="main-section" id="ifelse" >
<h2>If...else Statement</h2>
<p>Now we'll learn conditional statement.In this case we'll set our programme to work on different condition.In C we'll use <b>If...else</b> statement. </p>
<p>It has the following syntax. </p>
<code><pre>
If(conditional expression)
{
...Statement 1...
}
else{
...Statement 2...
}
</pre></code>
<p>Here<b>Statement 1</b> being applied when condition is true neither <b>Statement 2</b> gets applied.</p>
<h3>Let's have a practice </h3>
<code><pre>
#include stdio.h<sup><span id="note">(*wrap with this <>)</span></sup>
int main(){

int number_1,number_2;

printf("Enter the two
numbers.");
scanf("%d\n%d",number_1
,number_2)
if(number_1==number_2){
printf("Both numbers are
equal.");
}
else{
printf("Both numbers are not
equal.");
}

return 0;
}
</pre></code>
<p>The code above, will take two numbers and then check them in condition.If condition is true
 programme will display the 1st statement nor it will display the 2nd statement. </p>
 <p>Remember to use <b>else if </b>statement in case of checking more conditions.</p>
